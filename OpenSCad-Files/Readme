# The various plastic parts.

## This is my first OpenSCAD project, so I learned as I went.

### Planned work.

1.  Improve and spell check to comments, adding better documentation of pourpose and better explaination of spaghetti code.
2.  Start cleaning up variouis modules to better paraterize them, including more constants with variables in constructs.
    - First functional improvment - add some holes in the flanges of the spools to make ataching the wires and ropes without disassembly is possible and easy.


#### The topmost capstan parts were the first to be modeled, working towards the bearing plate, and the back up to the motor mount.
     - I hope to redo them all to be more "paramterized" and more modular.  (Lots of spaghetti code on some...)  
     - Will go though them as time permits and improve the comments as well.
  
- My workflow...  (Some not implemented yet  :-)   )
  - Draw the proposed system in 2D using TurboCad to get good measurements and to help visualize.
    - Tried FreeCad, TinkerCad, and others - the learining curve was too steep after 20 years of TurboCad.
      -  After two days with FreeCad and giving up,  Had a set of capstan spools completed with OpenSCAD in a few hours!
  - Design the solid parts and combine into a module.
  - Design the shapes that will be subtracted for holes and such and place into a module or two.
  - Combine the two into another module with "difference ()"
  - Call out the main module so it shows.
  - Try to use unique names (not competed) so that "include" can be used to assemble parts into views easier.
