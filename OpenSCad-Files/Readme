The various plastic parts.

This is my first OpenSCAD project, so I learned as I went.

The topmost capstan parts were the first to be modeled, working towards the bearing plate, and the back up to the motor mount.
- I hope to redo them all to be more "paramterized" and more modular.  (Lots of spaghetti code on some...)  
  - Will go thought them as time permits and improve the comments as well.
  
- My workflow...  (Some not implemented yet  :-)   )
  - Draw the proposed system in 2D using TurboCad to get good measurements and to help visualize.
    - Tried FreeCad, TinkerCad, and others - the learining curve was too steep after 20 years of TurboCad.
      -  After two days with FreeCad and giving up,  Had a set of capstan spools completed in a few hours!
  - Design the solid parts and combine into a module.
  - Design the shapes that will be subtracted for holes and such and place into a module or two.
  - Combine the two into another module with "difference ()"
  - Call out the main module so it shows.
  - Try to use unique names (not competed) so that "include" can be used to assemble parts into views easier.
